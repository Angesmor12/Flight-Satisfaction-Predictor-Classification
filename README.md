Flight Satisfaction Predictor ( Classification model )

Artificial Intelligence Project Focused on Classification Models

This project presents a classification model developed using a combination of machine learning algorithms, ensemble methods, and neural networks. The main objective is to analyze flight characteristics and predict whether customers are satisfied or dissatisfied with their experience. This repository provides a detailed overview of the entire process, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and the selection of the best-performing model for the task.
